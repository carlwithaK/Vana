addText("Once known as the ¡°Prince of Shadows¡±, Grandmaster Ryo possessed supreme speed and power with short-range daggers, and a longer, chain-like Claw.  A part-time member of the Bosshunters, he was renowned for an unparalleled ability to blend into the very night itself.  His legend grew during a battle with a Crimson Balrog, where he moved so swiftly, that its' attacks hit nothing but the air behind him. Ryo also performed occasional ¡°retrievals¡± for those less fortunate than himself.");
